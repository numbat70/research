Improve entrapreneurialism - Improve the economy - Lower/Remove Barriers  - Helping Startup * Innovative businesses Non-Customers - Grow the economy  - Support (especially rural) - Knowledge of funding - Net  Zero  - Growing Scotland - There to help Partners - Support for Scotland that the rest of UK does not get - Supporting Scaling companies - Companies think that we are needed but could improve delivery of services Insights - Customers better understand that you are not there simply to help them but to help the economy overall - One partner cited the value of SE compared to how it works in England.\u00a0 (You don\u2019t know how good SE is until it isn\u2019t there) - Customer perception is more aligned to BG objectives than SE\u2019s, suggesting continued misappropriation of roles.</p> Past Experience <p>Customers - Variable (More positive than Non-Customers) - Mostly for small companies - They take you so far, and then dry up - Tailored response :-) - Good to talk to actual people Non-Customers - Poor response rate - Not awesome - Bureaucratic  - Complicated - Poorly Executed - Too bossy &amp; time consuming (ROI) Insights - Mixed, largely negative,\u00a0 response from initial engagement. - Those non-customers that had an interaction with SE felt disappointed\u00a0 because of low levels of service. - Either it was deemed unhelpful or not relevant for their business, or it felt clinical, complicated and badly executed. - A lot of this is driven by having funding requests denied. - Or simply not meeting SE criteria and reacting to this badly. - (Entitlement culture and,\u00a0 frankly, laziness)</p> Relationship with SE <p>Customers  - Very good (mostly) - They do a lot of things for/with us - They can be a bit time consuming  - Some of their initiatives are good whilst some ar e bad - Bureaucratic - Good Relationships with AMs/Specialists  - Comms and Knowledge - Invested in Sustainability &amp; Net Zero - Helpful Non-Customers - Personal relationships are good - Possibly not that great for Start-Ups - Partners  - Evolving Insights - Customer experience is very positive overall. - The role of the AM is centrally and crucially\u00a0 important in the relationship. - However, some, who have been with SE for a long-time, complain about the inconsistency of AMs. - Partners are broadly supportive and positive.</p> What people think our Values are <p>Customers - Open &amp; Transparent - Agile (No description of what that means) - Collaborative - Invested in Equality, Inclusion, Sustainability and Diversity  - Your people go above and beyond - Driving employment - Selling Scotland Partners  - Growth - Inclusion &amp; Equality - Improving Scotland  - Supportive  - Sustainable Development Insights - No specific focus or sense of what your core values are - For many it was a difficult question to answer and resorted to guesswork. - Again, lack of speed coming through here from some partners.</p> How people feel about the Our Brand Purpose <p>Insights - It's too long.  - And it's a little jargony, but that's understandable to people  - And it recognizes that it needs to speak to businesses about how their support can drive the economy.  - And it recognizes that it needs to sneak to businesses about how their support can drive the economy  - However some misunderstanding that SF are innovators rather than driving innovation as stated)  - Nevertheless, it's broadly in line with perceptions and seems appropriate</p> Does our Purpose resonate with you <p>Insight  - Alienating to smaller businesses - It reflects but does not really connect with customers - Lacks Emotion &amp; Energy </p> Language <p>Insight  - There's a juxtaposition between the high-level language that's used in your purpose and the personal and accessible service that's offered by SE. - Too jargony comes through strongly - even for Partners - And to some extent also too corporate - for larger businesses - It's not as clear as it could be about Calls to Action and business benefits - Not from this but from the workshops there's just too much focus on SE rather than the customer.  - What's in it for me.</p> Language by other B2B <p>Customers  - Banks  - Consultancies (Deloittes, KPMG...) - Revolut - Slack Non-Customers  - FSB Newsletters - Chambers stuff :-) - xxx - xxx Partners  - Codebase - Techscaler - AWS  - Google for Start Ups Insight  - Non-customers relate more to networks and support organisations - Customers have a more high-brow point of reference \u2013 eg Consultancies</p> SE Business Ambitions- What do you think? <p>Insight  - Quite cynical - Most customers say this is reflective of their experience, EXPECT internationalization. Given rising costs and Brexit complexities, this makes internationalization difficult for businesses at the moment. - Are SE these things or do they enable these things?\u00a0 Watch out you don\u2019t overclaim.\u00a0 Your people are good at encouraging these things but the businesses themselves actually do it.</p> Do SE's ambitions resonate with you <p>Insight  - Depends on the business - SE is not innovative. It is the facilitator of Innovation.</p> Is SE driving innovation <p>Insight  - There\u2019s a theme emerging that SE shouldn\u2019t be claiming that they are innovators and that it\u2019s the companies they support that innovate.\u00a0 There\u2019s a risk that you sound like you are taking the credit for innovation or that it could at least be interpreted that way. -Talk more clearly about being facilitators and enabling</p> Understanding the Ecosystem <p>Insight  - Good awareness among customers and general assumption that they are about international trading - And SDI\u2019s positioning is a lot clearer than SE\u2019s.\u00a0 Feels more focused and targeted. - Generally positive attitudes to the SDI/SE relationship. - But for those who do not work with SDI\u00a0 it\u2019s not clear where overlap stops.</p> SDI <p>Insight  - Good awareness among customers and general assumption that they are about international trading - And SDI\u2019s positioning is a lot clearer than SE\u2019s.\u00a0 Feels more focused and targeted. - Generally positive attitudes to the SDI/SE relationship. - But for those who do not work with SDI\u00a0 it\u2019s not clear where overlap stops.</p> Business Gateway <p>Insight  - This is area of most confusion. - Many understand BG\u2019s role as a portal into SE but many more confuse SE for BG in conversation, especially small or start up non-customers of SE. - But people DO generally understand that BG is for start ups.\u00a0 (It\u2019s just that many think SE/BG are the same thing). - Even during respondent recruitment there was confusion with Free Found SE customers ACTUALLY being BG customers. - Seems to be a lot of misattribution to SE of services non-customers have experienced or more likely heard of that were actually provided by BG - Several respondents see BG as a UK national (not Scottish) entity. - BG advice and support seen as more off the shelf, not tailored like SE.</p> SMAS <p>Insight  - Very low awareness but relatively easy to guess their role. Not much real association with SE. - Only a handful of respondents had worked with them,</p> CDS (co-operative development scotland) <p>Insight  - Virtually no awareness across all groups </p> Brand Scotland <p>Insight  - Low awareness - If pushed, reasonably correct assumption that they promote Scotland. - No link to SE really.</p> Digital Chanels - Website CUSTOMERS  <p>Insight  - Quite a few have never used it at all - Reliance is on Account Manager, rather than digital channels \u2013 much more important and clouds opinion - Generally, slightly more negative than non-clients - Again, several comments that it is fairly unremarkable \u2013 but that could be seen as inoffensive - No spontaneous praise</p> Digital Chanels - Website NON-CUSTOMERS  <p>Insight  - Very mixed point of view, but leaning towards negative - No real issues with navigation - Largely seen as clean, text based and factual - Broadly seen as functional, and many find it easy to use \u2013 not especially engaging - But for many it\u2019s quite bland/unremarkable \u2013 a lot of comments about nothing standing out - Several mentions of stock photography usage - A bit wordy - Over emphasis on net zero and green agenda</p> Digital Chanels - Website PARTNERS  <p>Insight  - Possibly the most negative overall - Acknowledgment of need to meet a wide variety of audiences which is difficult</p> Digital Chanels - Brand Identity <p>Insight  - Very widely recognized - Some confusion with energy companies - Perfectly fit for purpose, but a minority see it as quite dated - It\u2019s not exactly setting the heather on fire, but neither is it damaging the brand</p> Digital Chanels - Youtube <p>Insight  - Mixed opinions and quite strongly held. - But largely an acknowledgement that video is a good medium, especially for case studies (although these also have detractors) - \u2018How to\u2019 videos are also welcome, but content is outdated - Low awareness of SE channel specifically - Not inappropriate</p> Digital Chanels - LinkedIn <p>Insight  - The star performer \u2013 your natural home - Very strongly endorsed - Not many follow the SE page, and some follow their AM \u2013 but seen as positive to customers - Great for communicating events and news/updates - You are acknowledged as using the medium well.</p> Digital Chanels - Facebook <p>Insight  - An ambivalent response - Seen as becoming quite outdated - Respondents struggled to understand WHY SE would use Facebook</p> Digital Chanels - Twitter <p>Insight  - Its reputation has been tarnished for serious business users recently - But it IS seen as a good business channel and an appropriate place for SE to communicate - Jury is out long term</p> Digital Chanels - Email <p>Insight  - This is your strongest engagement channel - But more for AM to customer engagement than marketing - It\u2019s seen as a communications rather than marketing channel \u2013 other than newsletter - Looking for more tailored content that\u2019s relevant to their circumstances - Of course, some note that email is generally overused in business so there are pros and cons here</p> Digital Chanels - Other <p>Insight  - Significant mention of TikTok as up and coming as a channel - even for SE - Instagram spontaneously mentioned as a useful channel for SE\u00a0 but less enthusiastically</p>"},{"location":"content/se_desk_research.html#2021-se-initial-research","title":"2021: SE Initial Research","text":""},{"location":"content/se_desk_research.html#files_1","title":"Files","text":"<ul> <li>SE.com-InitialResearch-Aug2021</li> </ul>"},{"location":"content/se_desk_research.html#summary_1","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Purpose - We are interested in where you would look on our site https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for information.</p> Results: Pass / Fail <p>Success: - Only one user found the event Masterclass selling your business      - But  - 4 users did find the webpage about succession planning  Fail: - One user made it to the learning zone but was unable to find the information  - One user made it to the funding and grants webpage and gave up - One user made it to the contact us webpage after failing to find the information - 4 users clicked on various bits on the homepage and gave up quickly  - 3 users used search and then gave up  Conclusions: - Events, podcasts and webinars are not obviously visible from the homepage  - Users are not explicitly searching for them  - Search doesn\u2019t work as well as it should</p> Missing Things: <ul> <li>I was hoping to find a page labeled \"management buy out\" or \"selling your company\".

I am also aware that I did not use anything other than the search function. .. So let me try that now.... Found relatively easily using menu also. So can't complain.</li> <li>I would have probably put it underneath COVID19 as an option, as the current climate a lot of business they are selling their companies, so it would been a naturally search progression as a customer. Probably would have suggested it being under a different tab, instead of development as I felt it didn't fit with developing/growing a business.</li> <li>I would like to change the search results page. It is because it provides too many less relevant results after using the keywork - selling my company.</li> <li>I wouldn't associate selling of a business under business development, so I would maybe have a clearer or separate heading for that type of advice. I also don't automatically know the phrase 'succession planning' so maybe having another more widely understandable phrase as a heading would be better.</li> <li>Have the relevant information at top of page for both management buyout and selling a company.

Some had successfully been awarded a SMART Scotland grant, others were given a grant to improve their website and one had just recently received a 'Make it to Market' grant.</li> <li>When asked how they searched for grant opportunities, some test participants used their SE account manager who advised them on funding opportunities available, others had either heard of a specific grant opportunity from peers, including business gateway or word of mouth from active communities they were involved in, such as CodeBase. Two test participants indicated that they would make an initial Google search </li> <li>Although all test participants were successful in applying for their business grants, there was still a great dealof uncertainty regarding the range of grants on offer from SE and from the public sector as a whole. There was a perception that finding a grant opportunity was only simple if businesses knew exactly the kind of grant they were looking for. Finding a suitable grant for their specific funding gap was much more problematic.</li> </ul> SE Grant Application Process <ul> <li>There was a perception from all test participants that the grant application process is confusing, frustrating, lengthy, and sometimes time-wasting, particularly when the eligibility criteria is not explained clearly and businesses invest a lot of time preparing an application, only to be refused a funding opportunity at the end of the process. </li> </ul> Experience and Expectations of SE Website <ul> <li>Test participants who had previously visited the SE website when  looking for funding opportunities felt that the range of grant opportunities were not easy to find, and/or clearly presented or explained. This is partly because there is no single page where all funding opportunities are presented and because it is difficult to identify relevant funding opportunities.</li> <li>Funding criteria varies from business to business and identifying opportunities to fit specific needs and circumstances can be extremely difficult.</li> <li>Another common barrier is the language and terminology used to describe grant opportunities and the eligibility criteria required to secure funding.</li> </ul> Encouraging Grant Applications <ul> <li>During testing, we asked participants what SE could do in order to encourage more grant applications and a number of suggestions were offered, including the use of in-bound marketing via social media and SEO to raise</li> <li>Another common suggestion from all participants was the need to make it more obvious what funding opportunities SE offer, including a single section of the website called 'Funding' which is clearly visible from the homepage and/or primary navigation. Clicking on this would provide an overview of all the funding/grants SE offer.</li> <li>All test participants suggested including a means of filtering funding options that are relevant to individual businesses. They suggested a tool/form which would allow businesses to complete a series of questions.</li> <li>Once complete, they would be presented with all relevant funding opportunities that they are eligible for.</li> <li>One test participant suggested developing a universal search tool which would provide a list of all grant/funding opportunities available to businesses, from both SE and from other agencies.</li> <li>Another test participant suggested uploading an example of a successful application form, with comments from reviewers. It was felt that this would help businesses understand the application process and what is required from the application form.</li> </ul> Audience <ul> <li>People are confused</li> </ul> Site Interaction <ul> <li>Participants all had experience of searching public sector for support</li> <li>What is available to a business is confusing</li> <li>Peers, Word of Mouth, Search Engines, Other agencies and Account Managers were all used to find support </li> <li>Businesses feel that they have to know exactly what they need in order to find the right grant.</li> <li>Applying for Grants is confusing</li> <li>Applying for grants can seem like more bother than it is worth (Opportunity Cost) </li> <li>There is no clear route to information on Funding Opportunities for businesses</li> <li>The APPLICATION sections seem light in Calls to Action and a clear direction. \"Make an Enquiry\" does not sound like \"Apply for this Grant\"</li> </ul> Structure <ul> <li>Have a nice simple FUNDING section</li> <li>Users welcome filtering of content to only show stuff that is relevant to them</li> <li>The way that grants are structured on the SE website does not support the users natural journey in finding grant opportunities</li> <li>Poor Search functionality &amp; SEO hinders success when the Structure does not meet users mental model (expectations)</li> <li>Certain info is in the wrong sections of pages (as seen by users).

We are aware that this is a project which is currently underway, although we would be happy to advise on effective search engines/experiences - Consider introducing a 'super navigation', providing a drop down function of the information available within each section of the primary navigation Marketing - SEO &amp; keyword analysis - Use Social media - Be clearer about what we do - Use SEO aware copywriters Content - Use Plain English to call things what they are - Use this Plain English in Filter options - Be clear up front - Remove unnecessary information - Where eligibility is complicated; give examples of how it can be use Applying - Consider adopting a consistent application process across all grant opportunities, as expected by users - Consider offering an online application form so that users can complete their application online - A simple way to do this would be to create an online account. If this was available, businesses could easily apply for future grants, having entered much of their business information previously to the system - Allow users to save, edit and return to their application form at a later date and display a visible progress bar of their application submission - As users start the application process, enable a facility to ask questions either via the application process and/or an online chat facility - Allow users to submit sections of their application form for review - Allow account managers/SE staff to flag changes, make notes and provide online guidance as part of the online application process, all through a secure area of the website - Include a visual progress indicator to show users where their application is in the process, with a timescale indication of when the application is likely to be complete</p> Tags <p>homepage, UX, Content, Structure, Language, Application</p>"},{"location":"content/se_desk_research.html#2015-nile-report","title":"2015: NILE REPORT","text":""},{"location":"content/se_desk_research.html#files_11","title":"Files","text":"<ul> <li>Nile Report April 2015 </li> </ul>"},{"location":"content/se_desk_research.html#summary_11","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>The current homepage design does not convey what SE does, and the businesses it helps. </li> <li>There is no clear user journey through the site for either the \u2018confused\u2019 or \u2018convinced\u2019 personas. </li> <li>The content of the site did not meet participants\u2019 expectations.
